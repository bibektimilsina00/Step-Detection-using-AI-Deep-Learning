# Optimized Step Detection API Deployment

## 🚀 Overview

This deployment setup is optimized to use **pre-trained models** instead of training on the server, resulting in:

- ✅ **Faster startup** - No training required on server
- ✅ **Smaller Docker images** - No training data needed
- ✅ **Better performance** - Model is already optimized
- ✅ **Consistent results** - Same model across all deployments

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your machine and server
- Docker Hub account (for pushing images)
- Python 3.11+ (for local training)

## 🏗️ Build Process

### 1. Local Development & Training

```bash
# Train the model locally (automatic in build scripts)
python train_and_save_model.py

# This creates: models/trained_step_detection_model.pth
```

### 2. Build & Push Docker Image

```bash
# Build and push to Docker Hub
./build.sh -u your_dockerhub_username

# Or build locally only
./build.sh --no-push
```

**What happens during build:**

1. ✅ Checks if pre-trained model exists
2. 🏃‍♂️ Trains model if not found (only once locally)
3. 📦 Builds Docker image with pre-trained model
4. 🚀 Pushes to Docker Hub

### 3. Server Deployment

```bash
# On your server
./deploy.sh -u your_dockerhub_username -p 8080
```

**What happens during deployment:**

1. 📥 Pulls latest image from Docker Hub
2. 🛑 Stops old container
3. 🚀 Starts new container with pre-trained model
4. ✅ Ready to serve requests immediately

## 🎯 Workflow Comparison

### ❌ Old Workflow (Training on Server)

```
Local → Build → Push → Deploy → Train on Server → Ready
                                    ⏰ 2-5 minutes
```

### ✅ New Workflow (Pre-trained Model)

```
Local Training → Build → Push → Deploy → Ready
   ⏰ 30s           📦      🚀      ✅ <10s
```

## 🛠️ Quick Commands

### Local Development

```bash
# Quick local build and run
./build-and-run.sh

# Check container status
docker logs -f step-detection-api

# API documentation
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

### Production Deployment

```bash
# Build and push
./build.sh -u yourusername

# Deploy on server
./deploy.sh -u yourusername -p 8080

# Check deployment
curl http://your-server:8080/health
```

## 📊 Performance Benefits

| Metric            | Old Approach         | New Approach | Improvement    |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| Container startup | 2-5 minutes          | <10 seconds  | **30x faster** |
| Image size        | ~2GB                 | ~500MB       | **4x smaller** |
| CPU usage         | High during training | Low          | **Optimized**  |
| Memory usage      | High during training | Low          | **Optimized**  |
| Consistency       | Variable             | Consistent   | **Reliable**   |

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Optional: Set Docker Hub token for automated builds
export DOCKER_TOKEN=your_docker_token

# Build configuration
export DOCKER_USER=your_dockerhub_username
```

### Model Configuration

The pre-trained model is automatically loaded from:

```
models/trained_step_detection_model.pth
```

### API Configuration

- **Port**: 8000 (container) → 8080 (host)
- **Health check**: `/health` endpoint
- **Documentation**: `/docs` and `/redoc`

## 🐳 Docker Images

### Production Image Structure

```
app/
├── models/
│   └── trained_step_detection_model.pth  # Pre-trained model
├── *.py                                  # Application code
├── pyproject.toml                        # Dependencies
└── uv.lock                              # Locked dependencies
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Model Training Issues

```bash
# Check if model exists
ls -la models/

# Retrain model
python train_and_save_model.py

# Check model file
ls -la models/trained_step_detection_model.pth
```

### Container Issues

```bash
# Check container logs
docker logs step-detection-api

# Check container health
docker exec step-detection-api curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Restart container
docker restart step-detection-api
```

### Deployment Issues

```bash
# Check if image exists on Docker Hub
docker pull your_username/step-detection-ai:latest

# Force rebuild
./build.sh -u your_username --no-push
docker build --no-cache -t your_username/step-detection-ai:latest .
```

## 📈 Monitoring

### API Health Check

```bash
curl http://your-server:8080/health
```

### Container Status

```bash
docker ps --filter name=step-detection-api
```

### Performance Metrics

```bash
# API stats
curl http://your-server:8080/stats

# Container stats
docker stats step-detection-api
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Customize the model**: Edit `train_and_save_model.py` to use your data
2. **Scale deployment**: Use load balancers or orchestration tools
3. **Monitor performance**: Add logging and metrics collection
4. **Optimize further**: Use model quantization or TensorRT for faster inference
